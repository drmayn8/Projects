    <img src="image.webp">
    <p><strong>With a mix of fresh and frozen vegetables, this chicken dinner is super-affordable and customizable. Dig into your spice cabinet to season the chicken breasts with dried parsley and basil, then add frozen mixed veggies and fresh grape tomatoes, green onions, and zucchini. A scoop of sun-dried tomato pesto ties everything together, and you can enjoy the protein and produce mix as a one-pot pasta, over rice, or alongside mashed potatoes.</strong></p>
